# Financial-Protection-Advisor
This repository is for a webapp that aims to provide users with information about the consumer-friendliness of financial instutions, products, and services.  The application was built with Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, Oracle Database, and a hefty amount of SQL.

### Setup

1. Download [Oracle Instant Client (32 bit)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/downloads/index.html) and add it to the system PATH variables.
2. Install Rails.  The [Ruby 2.3 Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/en) worked well.
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) may also be required.
